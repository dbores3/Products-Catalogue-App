# Products Catalogue App
## _Product Listing & Ordering_


Products Catalogue App is a module in charge of displaying a list of products from the Database, paginate them & order them by their price. Powered with PHP & ReactJS. In the PHP's Back-End I chose OOP over scripting so the code is easier to read & frameworks like Symfony or Laravel make extensive use of object-oriented mechanisms.
The project is separated into the fronted(React) and the API(PHP).

## Features

- Display a list of the products
- Add Pagination
- Order by price

## Tech

Products Catalogue App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Programming language
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript Library for building interfaces
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - Programming language
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) - Tool to check the code's security
- [Sass](https://snyk.io/) - Tool to check the code's security
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Javascript's testing framework
- [PhpUnit](https://phpunit.de/) - Javascript's testing framework

## Installation

Products Catalogue App requires NPM/Yarn, PHP & Mysql/MariaDB to run.

Serve the Back-End's code, so the React can fetch the data from it.

```sh
cd api/
php -S http://localhost:8080
```

Install & serve the react app..
